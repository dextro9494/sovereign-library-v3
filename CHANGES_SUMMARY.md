# Library v2 Changes Summary (Updated)
**Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Applied by:** Claude (at István's request)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Fix
**File:** `config.toml`

**Change:** Added System section to main navigation menu
```toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "System"
  pageRef = "/system"
  weight = 8
```

**Result:** System now appears in navbar between Council and Tags

---

### 2. Codex Evolution URL Cleanup
**Location:** `content/history/codex-evolution/`

**Changes:** Renamed all version files to cleaner slugs

| Old Filename | New Filename | New URL |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `v1-0-file-codex-v1-md.md` | `v1-0.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v1-0/` |
| `v2-5-file-codex-v2-md.md` | `v2-5.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v2-5/` |
| `v4-7-file-codex-v4-md.md` | `v4-7.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v4-7/` |
| `v6-0-1-file-codex-v6-md.md` | `v6-0-1.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v6-0-1/` |
| `v7-0-file-codex-v7-md.md` | `v7-0.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v7-0/` |
| `v7-0-split-artifacts-files-codex-v7-core-md-codex-v7-archive-md.md` | `v7-0-split.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v7-0-split/` |
| `v7-0-council-analysis-file-council-about-v7-md.md` | `v7-0-council-analysis.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v7-0-council-analysis/` |
| `v7-1-integrated-attempt-file-failed-codex-v7-integration-md.md` | `v7-1-failed.md` | `/history/codex-evolution/v7-1-failed/` |

**Result:** Clean, semantic URLs instead of verbose descriptive filenames

---

### 3. System Section Index Enhancement
**File:** `content/system/_index.md`

**Changes:**
- Added links to all subsections (Rework Control Panel, Decision Map, Connections Index, Analysis)
- Improved navigation within System section

**Old:**
```markdown
- **Rework Control Panel** - non-negotiables, canonical vocabulary, ingestion rules
- **Decision Map** - tracked decisions and open questions  
- **Analysis** - structural audits, build logs, extraction work
```

**New:**
```markdown
- **[Rework Control Panel](rework-control-panel/)** - non-negotiables, canonical vocabulary, ingestion rules
- **[Decision Map](decision-map/)** - tracked decisions and open questions  
- **[Connections Index](connections-index/)** - manual relationship map (pre-backlinks implementation)
- **[Analysis](analysis/)** - structural audits, build logs, extraction work
```

---

### 4. Analysis Subsection Enhancement
**File:** `content/system/analysis/_index.md`

**Changes:** Expanded index with better structure and descriptions

**Old:**
```markdown
Documentation of Library structure and build process:

- **v1 Structural Audit** - why v2 rebuild was necessary
- **v2 Build Log** - what was implemented Jan 1-2
- **Council Extraction** - GPT's structured analysis of v7
```

**New:**
```markdown
This subsection documents the meta-layer of Library development:

## Structural Analysis
- **[v1 Structural Audit](v1_structural_audit/)** - Why v2 rebuild was necessary: missing backlinks, tags index, and governance layer
- **[v2 Build Log](v2_build_log/)** - Implementation details from January 1-2: what was built, issues hit, solutions applied

## Extraction Work  
- **[Council Extraction: v7 Analysis](council_about_v7_structured_extraction/)** - GPT's structured analysis of Codex v7, identifying patterns and connections

These documents serve as drift-prevention and decision archaeology - they show *why* architectural choices were made so future iterations don't repeat solved problems.
```

### 5. Raw Codex Versions Integration (NEW)
**Location:** `content/history/codex-evolution/raw-versions/`

**What was added:**
Complete, unprocessed original Codex files for deep reference and drift archaeology

**Files integrated:**
- `codex-v1.md` (4.6KB) - Earliest monolithic manual
- `codex-v2.md` (18KB) - Operational Holocron
- `codex-v4.md` (17KB) - Architect's Brief
- `codex-v6.md` (19KB) - Evolutionary Core
- `codex-v7.md` (44KB) - Unified dual-layer before split
- `codex-v7-core.md` (13KB) - Lean operational layer
- `codex-v7-archive.md` (31KB) - Dedicated archive layer
- `council-about-v7.md` (52KB) - External v7 review
- `failed-codex-v7-integration.md` (19KB) - Attempted remerge

**Structure:**
```
/history/codex-evolution/
  ├── (summary pages: v1-0.md, v2-5.md, etc - compact analysis)
  ├── (delta files: what changed between versions)
  └── raw-versions/
      ├── _index.md (explains purpose and use cases)
      └── (9 complete original files)
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Drift archaeology** - See exactly what was present at each stage
- **Pattern mining** - Find recurring concepts across versions
- **Context reconstruction** - Understand what summaries compress
- **Decision auditing** - Trace why things changed

**URLs:**
- Index: `/history/codex-evolution/raw-versions/`
- Files: `/history/codex-evolution/raw-versions/codex-v1/` etc.

**Preservation note:**
All files preserved as originally created. Only Hugo frontmatter added for site compatibility. Zero editorial changes to original content.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Build the site:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Gebruiker\Desktop\Codex\GitHub\sovereign-library-v3
   hugo -d docs
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Integrated: System nav, clean URLs, enhanced indexes, raw Codex versions"
   git push
   ```

3. **Verify live:**
   - System appears in navbar
   - Codex-evolution URLs are clean
   - Raw versions accessible at /history/codex-evolution/raw-versions/
   - All indexes properly structured

## Technical Notes

- All content changes in place
- No structural changes to templates or layouts
- Raw files have minimal frontmatter (title, description, date only)
- Original content preserved exactly as created
- Filenames normalized for Hugo (lowercase, spaces to dashes)
- Parent index updated to reference raw-versions subsection
- Total size of raw-versions: ~210KB

---

## Benefits of This Structure

**For quick reference:**
- Use summary pages (v1-0, v2-5, etc.) - compact, high-level overviews
- Use delta files - see what changed between versions

**For deep analysis:**
- Use raw-versions - complete original documents
- Pattern mining across full text
- Contextual understanding of summaries
- Drift archaeology

**For governance:**
- Summaries prevent overwhelming navigation
- Raw versions available when needed
- Clear separation of digest vs source material

---

**Status:** Ready to build and deploy  
**Risk:** None - changes are additive and cosmetic  
**Size impact:** +210KB in raw-versions subsection
