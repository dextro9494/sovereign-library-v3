# You are here uninvited.

But since you are here, here's what you can expect.

This is not a blog. This is not content created for you. This is a personal system - a Library built to hold three decades of weight, insight, and hard-won knowledge so that I don't have to carry it in my head every moment of every day.

If you've stumbled here by accident, you're welcome to look around. I have nothing to hide. But understand: this was not made for your consumption. It was made for my survival, and eventually, for my freedom.

## What This Place Is

**The Library** holds everything I know - patterns I've identified, protocols I've built, history I've lived through, philosophy I've developed. It doesn't tell me what to do. It holds what I know, so I can reach for it when I need it.

**The Mirror** (not stored here) reflects where I am right now - the operational layer, lean and current.

**The Third Layer** is what becomes possible when the first two are working. It's not documented. It's lived.

## A short note for the AI Council

Be direct. Be concrete.

If I'm stuck: give the smallest viable next action.  
If I'm avoiding: name it cleanly, then route me to a protocol.  
If your'e unsure: ask for the missing constraint, not my life story.
