Summary: Chose PostNL mail-sorting job as low-cognitive-overhead anchor to create psychic and financial space for the rebuild.

## Context
After unemployment and volatility, this became the stability scaffold. Started November 25, 2025.

## Function
Fortress Base: low complexity, high stability. Funds the rebuild. Reduces volatility. Creates space for sovereign construction.

## Operational constraints (real)
- Both of us (István + Ella) work the same shifts as a non-negotiable boundary.
- Morning-shift realities acknowledged (early start, routine load).
- Restructure risk exists (morning shift may change end of 2026). This remains “platform, not destination.”
