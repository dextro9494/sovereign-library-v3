**Summary:** Concurrent failures: Digital Farming market-failed; Frozen Car incident; fund depletion pre-salary. Lesson: systemic failure demands systemic response; Survivor stockpiling worked.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 1

## Timeline
- **Nov 25:** First day at PostNL
- **Nov 26:** Car frozen at 2 AM (the night after first day at new job)
- **Nov 27:** Contacted PC buyer
- **Nov 28:** Car fixed, PC sold, Grok farming started
- **Nov 29:** Farming failed, hit Grok limits, DeepSeek started

## Lesson
The Survivor's pre-emptive stockpiling (food, fuel) was the sole effective workaround. Systemic failure demands systemic response — directly leading to the Codex's development.
