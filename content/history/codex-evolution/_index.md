This folder maps the **Codex lineage** from the earliest monolithic manual to the dual-layer (Core + Archive) architecture.

**Why this exists:** drift control. If a label or module keeps reappearing, we want to know **where it came from**, **what it solved**, and **what it broke**.

## Timeline (compressed)

### 1) v1.0 (file: Codex v1.md)
- **Date range / integration:** 2025-11-late → 2025-12-14-ish (per manifest, approximate)
- **Identity:** Builder
- **Frame:** Monolithic master note / field manual
- **Key moves:**
  - Baseline analysis + psychological OS + long-term vision + assets/vulnerabilities + command protocols
  - Introduces: AI Council protocol, RCP, Dark Council directive, strategic modules (incl. gated 'AI harem' concept)
  - Contains placeholders for an 'iteration ledger' (active entries list)

### 2) v2.5 (file: Codex v2.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-14
- **Identity:** Builder
- **Frame:** Operational Holocron
- **Key moves:**
  - Adds explicit versioning/status metadata and an Executive Overview (0. section)
  - Strengthens Builder vs Survivor framing and 'mission active' tone (Dark Council in session)
  - Keeps the same major module stack as v1 while making it more operational

### 3) v4.7 (file: Codex v4.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-25
- **Identity:** Builder
- **Frame:** Architect's Brief (procurement-integrated)
- **Key moves:**
  - Purpose shift: from 'become obsolete' → 'become seamlessly integrated' foundation
  - Adds Continuity Anchor: 'Builder present. Architecture intact.'
  - Introduces a clean protocol suite: 5-Second Engine Ignition, R-COM, RCP, AI communication directive
  - Adds stress-test section + explicit deprecated systems section

### 4) v6.0.1 (file: Codex v6.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-25
- **Identity:** Sovereign Operator
- **Frame:** Evolutionary Core (occupied & governing)
- **Key moves:**
  - Identity shift Builder → Operator; tone: 'occupied territory'
  - Re-architecture into dashboard/registry/library/protocols plus narrative/intelligence archive + field data log
  - Reality Check replaces Continuity Anchor: 'Sovereign present. Systems live. Next action identified.'
  - Adds Contingency Protocols + explicit Evolution Protocol

### 5) v7.0 (file: Codex v7.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-26
- **Identity:** Sovereign Operator
- **Frame:** Dual-layer system (Core + Archive)
- **Key moves:**
  - Formalizes two layers: Core (act) and Archive (remember)
  - Moves archive concerns into a dedicated Archive architecture (5 volumes) instead of being embedded
  - Core keeps: dashboard/registry/library/protocols; Archive gets: structure, access, migration protocols

### 6) v7.0 split artifacts (files: Codex v7 core.md + Codex v7 Archive.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Post-split packaging
- **Identity:** Sovereign Operator
- **Frame:** Separate Core and Archive documents
- **Key moves:**
  - Core becomes truly lean (no archive section)
  - Archive becomes a dedicated reference with volumes + story/entry format

### 7) v7.0 council analysis (file: Council about v7.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Post-v7 review
- **Identity:** N/A
- **Frame:** External analysis + recommendations
- **Key moves:**
  - Confirms dual-layer architecture is sound
  - Flags vulnerabilities: synchronization, retrieval under crisis, and 'strategic framing as avoidance'
  - Recommends: Builder/Survivor model note (anti-dogma), self-deception audit protocol, crisis retrieval map

### 8) v7.1 integrated attempt (file: Failed Codex v7 integration.md)
- **Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-28
- **Identity:** Sovereign Operator
- **Frame:** Integrated dual-layer (monolithic remerge)
- **Key moves:**
  - Re-merges Core + Archive + indexes/retrieval maps into one system document
  - Adds master tag index, council theme index, and IF X → SEE Y retrieval map
  - Labeled 'failed integration' in manifest: likely too heavy for daily execution layer
