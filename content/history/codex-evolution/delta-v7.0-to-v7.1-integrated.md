## Changes
- Re-merged Core + Archive + retrieval maps into a single integrated document.
- Added tag index, council theme index, IF X → SEE Y map (excellent for retrieval, risky for bloat).
- Manifest labels it as a failed integration attempt, implying operational friction outweighed retrieval benefits.
