These are the **recurring failure modes** visible across versions.

## Trap 1: Monolith re-formation
When the action layer and the storage layer re-merge, the system becomes heavy and daily execution slows.
- v7.0 solved this by separating Core and Archive.
- v7.1 (integrated attempt) appears to reintroduce monolithic weight via indexes + embedded archive.

**Guardrail:** keep a lean execution surface, and keep memory elsewhere (Archive/Library).

## Trap 2: Ritual without movement
Any “opening” that doesn’t end in an action becomes a ceremony.
**Guardrail:** Reality Check must always yield a Next Action.

## Trap 3: Model ossification (Builder/Survivor becoming dogma)
The Builder/Survivor map is useful for navigation, but harmful if treated as permanent metaphysics.
**Guardrail:** treat models as tools, not identities.

## Trap 4: Strategic framing as emotional avoidance
Claude flagged the risk: clinical tone can mask dissociation.
**Guardrail:** add a self-deception audit trigger (e.g., “Can I read the hardest story and still feel it?”).

## Trap 5: Expansion as substitution
Modules (AI, fantasies, “optimization”) can become substitutes for real-world sovereignty.
**Guardrail:** RCP stays the gate: “Does this build verifiable material sovereignty?”

## Trap 6: Council becomes committee
Too much deliberation replaces execution.
**Guardrail:** Throttle Clause: Council is for precision and blind spots, not endless debate.
