This subsection contains the complete, unprocessed original Codex files. These are the full documents as they existed at each version, preserved for historical reference and deep analysis.

## What's here

Unlike the summary pages at the parent level (v1-0, v2-5, etc.), these are the **complete original files** - everything that was in each version, unedited and unabridged.

### Available versions:
- **[Codex v1](codex-v1/)** - The earliest monolithic manual (4.5KB)
- **[Codex v2](codex-v2/)** - Operational Holocron iteration (18KB)
- **[Codex v4](codex-v4/)** - Architect's Brief with procurement integration (17KB)
- **[Codex v6](codex-v6/)** - Evolutionary Core, Sovereign Operator era (18KB)
- **[Codex v7](codex-v7/)** - Unified dual-layer system before split (44KB)
- **[Codex v7 Core](codex-v7-core/)** - Lean operational layer after split (13KB)
- **[Codex v7 Archive](codex-v7-archive/)** - Dedicated archive layer after split (31KB)
- **[Council Analysis: v7](council-about-v7/)** - External review of v7 architecture (52KB)
- **[Failed v7 Integration](failed-v7-integration/)** - Attempted monolithic remerge (18KB)

## Use cases

- **Drift archaeology** - See exactly what was present at each stage
- **Pattern mining** - Find recurring concepts across versions
- **Context reconstruction** - Understand what summaries compress
- **Decision auditing** - See what was tried and why it changed

## Note on preservation

These files are preserved as originally created, with no editorial changes. Frontmatter has been added only to make them Hugo-compatible. All original content, formatting, and structure is intact.
