This is the **anti-recursion ledger**: when old terms reappear, you can see what they became (or why they were retired).

## Identity
- **Builder** → **Sovereign Operator** (v6.0.1).  
  Builder = architecting and pouring foundations. Operator = governing occupied territory.

## “Entry ritual”
- **Continuity Anchor:** “Builder present. Architecture intact.” (v4.7)  
  → **Reality Check:** “Sovereign present. Systems live. Next action identified.” (v6.0.1)  
  → **Reality Check (dual-layer):** “Sovereign present. Systems live. Core active. Archive accessible.” (v7 core)

## Architecture labels
- **Operational Holocron** (v2.5) → **Architect’s Brief** (v4.7) → **Evolutionary Core** (v6.0.1) → **Dual-Layer System** (v7.0)

## Deprecated / faded modules
- **R-COM (Chaotic Object Management)** appears in v4.7 and then disappears (v6+).
- **Dark Council directive / “Dark Council in session”** appears early (v1–v2.5) and fades out by v6+.
- **“AI Harem Architecture”** exists as a gated concept in v1–v2.5 and does not continue as a first-class module after v4.7.

## Stable continuities (terms that persist)
- **RCP (Real-World Connection Filter)** persists and becomes more central from v4.7 onward.
- **5-Second Ignition** persists (v4.7 → v6/v7 Core).
- **Council throttle / engagement rules** persist and become more formal in v6/v7.
