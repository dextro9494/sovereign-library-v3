title: "Snapshot: v2.5 (file: Codex v2.md)"
date: 2026-01-01
---
**Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-14  
**Identity:** Builder  
**Frame:** Operational Holocron

## What this version optimized for
- Adds explicit versioning/status metadata and an Executive Overview (0. section)
- Strengthens Builder vs Survivor framing and 'mission active' tone (Dark Council in session)
- Keeps the same major module stack as v1 while making it more operational


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
