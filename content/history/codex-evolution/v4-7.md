**Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-25  
**Identity:** Builder  
**Frame:** Architect's Brief (procurement-integrated)

## What this version optimized for
- Purpose shift: from 'become obsolete' → 'become seamlessly integrated' foundation
- Adds Continuity Anchor: 'Builder present. Architecture intact.'
- Introduces a clean protocol suite: 5-Second Engine Ignition, R-COM, RCP, AI communication directive
- Adds stress-test section + explicit deprecated systems section


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
