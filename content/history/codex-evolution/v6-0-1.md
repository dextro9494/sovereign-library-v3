title: "Snapshot: v6.0.1 (file: Codex v6.md)"
date: 2026-01-01

**Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-25  
**Identity:** Sovereign Operator  
**Frame:** Evolutionary Core (occupied & governing)

## What this version optimized for
- Identity shift Builder → Operator; tone: 'occupied territory'
- Re-architecture into dashboard/registry/library/protocols plus narrative/intelligence archive + field data log
- Reality Check replaces Continuity Anchor: 'Sovereign present. Systems live. Next action identified.'
- Adds Contingency Protocols + explicit Evolution Protocol


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
