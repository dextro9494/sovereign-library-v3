title: "Snapshot: v7.0 council analysis (file: Council about v7.md)"
date: 2026-01-01
---
**Date range / integration:** Post-v7 review  
**Identity:** N/A  
**Frame:** External analysis + recommendations

## What this version optimized for
- Confirms dual-layer architecture is sound
- Flags vulnerabilities: synchronization, retrieval under crisis, and 'strategic framing as avoidance'
- Recommends: Builder/Survivor model note (anti-dogma), self-deception audit protocol, crisis retrieval map


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
