title: "Snapshot: v7.0 split artifacts (files: Codex v7 core.md + Codex v7 Archive.md)"
date: 2026-01-01
---
**Date range / integration:** Post-split packaging  
**Identity:** Sovereign Operator  
**Frame:** Separate Core and Archive documents

## What this version optimized for
- Core becomes truly lean (no archive section)
- Archive becomes a dedicated reference with volumes + story/entry format


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
