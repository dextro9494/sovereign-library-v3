title: "Snapshot: v7.0 (file: Codex v7.md)"
date: 2026-01-01
---
**Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-26  
**Identity:** Sovereign Operator  
**Frame:** Dual-layer system (Core + Archive)

## What this version optimized for
- Formalizes two layers: Core (act) and Archive (remember)
- Moves archive concerns into a dedicated Archive architecture (5 volumes) instead of being embedded
- Core keeps: dashboard/registry/library/protocols; Archive gets: structure, access, migration protocols


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
