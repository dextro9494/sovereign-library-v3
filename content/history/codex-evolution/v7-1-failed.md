title: "Snapshot: v7.1 integrated attempt (file: Failed Codex v7 integration.md)"
date: 2026-01-01
---
**Date range / integration:** Integrated 2025-12-28  
**Identity:** Sovereign Operator  
**Frame:** Integrated dual-layer (monolithic remerge)

## What this version optimized for
- Re-merges Core + Archive + indexes/retrieval maps into one system document
- Adds master tag index, council theme index, and IF X → SEE Y retrieval map
- Labeled 'failed integration' in manifest: likely too heavy for daily execution layer


## What to keep (for v8+)
- Keep the *intent* that survives version jumps; retire the labels that don’t.

## What to watch (drift risk)
- See: [Drift Traps](../drift-traps/)
