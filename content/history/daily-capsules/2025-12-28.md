## Snapshot
- Primary thread: v8 becomes physical reality (site exists, not just theory).
- System stance: structure first, then content.
- State marker: multiple internal shifts detected, not just plans.

## Changes
- Library website goes live (Hugo installed, skeleton built, local server running).
- v8 architecture stabilizes as three layers: Library (holds), Mirror (operational now), Third Layer (lived/emerging).
- Navigation model chosen: topic indexes + tags + cross-links ("connected").
- Council governance rules captured into continuity (Director authority + Throttle Clause + mode switching).
- Continuity save documents established as infrastructure against session amnesia and token loss.
- Nightmare recovery pattern shifts: trigger fired, old crash did not follow.
- "Filter off" becomes explicit: no mask, no shame leverage, no performance required.
- Activation Energy Gap identified in leisure (things loved but unreachable still count).
- Boxing moves from desire to confirmed direction (beginners together, Third Layer as practice).
- First exemplar entries created as proof the system can hold structured knowledge.

## Decisions / Commitments
- "Library and Mirror are buildable. Third Layer is discovered." Treat this as operating truth.
- The Library holds weight. The Mirror stays lean, current, portable.
- Council is for blind spots, not comfort: ask "What connection did I miss?"
- Include everything in processing, then tag by maturity (raw / working / canonical).

## Models & Insights
- External hard drive model: mind becomes processor, not storage.
- Builder/Survivor as core diagnostic: lockout is threat firmware, not laziness.
- "The world I'd build" re-affirmed as north-star spine.
- v8 correction to v7: simple enough to use under pressure.

## Operational Data
- Local dev run: Hugo server + section skeleton.
- Assets inventory noted: large batch of PDFs and raw material queued.

## Production Event (late evening)
- Content population completed: Hugo-ready markdown pack generated from the 7-batch run.
- Timeline verification table established (Nov 25 → Dec 28) to correct date drift.
- Clarifications locked (example set):
  - Therapy as Recon proposed, not executed.
  - Mattress selected, not ordered yet.
  - Protocol 6.2 saga date pinned.
  - Premium purchase dates separated (Claude/GPT vs LinkedIn).

## Anchors
- “The third layer has to come into existence by means of the foundation I can actually build.”
- “Your brain becomes the processor, not the storage.”
- “Ask: What connection did I miss?”
- “The Library is no longer a concept. It’s files waiting to be placed.”

## Open loops
- Meta-entries still needed: The Library, The Mirror, The Third Layer.
- Under-defined concepts flagged: Success Dance, Pleasure Architecture, Council role map.
- Hosting roadmap: localhost now, later public domain when ready.

## Notes for future integration
- Promote Activation Energy Gap into a dedicated Pattern entry if it repeats with more examples.
- Extract Continuity Save Protocol into a Protocol checklist page.

## Raw preserved (not published here)
- Full save docs retained in private archive:
