## Snapshot
- Primary thread: a consolidated “complete save” locks continuity across 28–30 Dec.
- System status: Library complete; Third Layer forming; Mirror pending.
- End-of-day state: stable and grounded. “Day well spent.”

## Changes
- v8 architecture restated as operating truth: Library / Mirror / Third Layer.
- Installation and deployment clarified: “entries ready to deploy” with folder-by-folder copy instructions.
- “Fortress Base” explicitly named as the stability scaffold funding sovereignty build.
- Health thread logged: lifelong mouth-breathing likely structural; ENT fix parked as non-urgent.
- Planning horizon becomes structured: Jan–July 2026 plan written with milestones and dependencies.
- Boxing timeline adjusted (postponed start) and turned into a concrete Third Layer marker.
- LinkedIn strategy becomes operational: volume-first to 100+, then targeted.

## Decisions / Commitments
- Mirror will be the portable operational layer pasted into sessions (defined, not built yet).
- Investments begin January 2026 (two-bucket automation: long-term ETF + emergency fund).
- Car purchase is a cash-only plan, with maintenance buffer (April–May 2026 target).
- License exchange planned before car purchase; accept a short “license-less” window.
- Housing move inquiry scheduled (Feb–Mar landlord conversation; Heerlen house as expansion vector).
- Park Dutch learning until capacity returns.

## Models & Insights
- External hard drive model: Library holds weight so the brain can be processor.
- Builder/Survivor re-affirmed as correct lockout diagnosis.
- Doctrine weight clarified: “release,” not “process” is the point.

## Operational Data
- Budget, debt runway, toeslagen correction window, investment instrument choices.
- License exchange steps and costs.
- Car search checklist and known issues.
- Housing math and narrative leverage.
- Boxing details: gym, trainer contact, gear list and budget.

## Anchors
- “No one is coming. You must be your own first responder.”
- “Your brain becomes the processor, not the storage.”
- “Through victory, your chains are broken.”
- “Movement.”

## Open loops
- Fiscal partnership registration (tax advantage vs complexity).
- ENT appointment timing for breathing issue.
- Weed spend reduction as Third Layer strengthens.
- Book idea: format and timing (parked, not dead).
- Mirror implementation: decide format and where it lives on the site.

## Notes for future integration
- Create a “Mirror Boot Sequence” once the Mirror is ready to publish.
- Promote Two-bucket Finance and License Exchange into standalone protocol pages when repetition warrants.

## Raw preserved (not published here)
- Full consolidated save and installation guide retained in private archive:
