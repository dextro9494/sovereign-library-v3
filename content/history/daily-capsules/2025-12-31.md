## Snapshot
- Primary thread: Library goes fully public and stable. Council continuity gets formalized.
- State marker: ending the year building, not surviving.

## Changes
- GitHub account created and workflow learned (commit → push → deploy).
- Folder structure error fixed; home link/baseURL issue corrected.
- Library is now live and accessible online (public, stable URL).
- Library inventory is made explicit (content folders + counts + total files).
- v8 architecture written as a single consolidated foundation doc fit for pasting into any session.
- Council cross-examination methodology designed (cold reads → cross-exams → synthesis).
- Council prompts created as ready-to-use templates per member.

## Decisions / Commitments
- PostNL remains “Fortress Base” until April 2026 job market window opens.
- LinkedIn strategy stays volume-first until a stable baseline is reached (100+ connections).
- Investments start January 2026 (long-term ETF + emergency buffer).
- License exchange path chosen (Hungarian → Dutch) before car purchase window.
- Car decision locked (cash + buffer; “think of myself for once” is a valid reason).
- Housing move is treated as a strategic expansion option (Kerkrade → Heerlen).

## Models & Insights
- Builder/Survivor: Survivor lockout is threat firmware, not laziness.
- Core axiom restated: “No one is coming. You must be your own first responder.”
- “The world I want to build is the world I never had” becomes explicit meaning engine.
- Doctrine crystallizes around “release” (chains broken) rather than endless processing.

## Operational Data (numbers + plans)
- Monthly finances logged (income/expenses/buffer) with a specific incoming toeslagen window in January 2026.
- Next 6 months mapped as a timeline (Jan → July) with key events: boxing start, accounts setup, landlord conversation, car purchase, job market window.
- Work status documented (direct contract since Nov 25, 2025; morning shift realities; restructure risk end of 2026).
- LinkedIn baseline captured (connections/following/weekly limit hit).

## Third Layer Evidence (lived)
- Self-care markers recorded (routine, grooming, hair growth, treating self as worth caring for).
- Boxing framed as Third Layer catalyst (shared practice with Ella).
- Mood marker: allowing good feelings without punishment.

## Anchors
- “No one is coming. You must be your own first responder.”
- “If I’m right you’re gonna agree. If I’m not you’re gonna correct me.”
- “Through victory, your chains are broken.”
- “I’m letting myself be myself.”
- “Movement.”

## Open loops
- Meta-entries still needed: The Library, The Mirror, The Third Layer (as self-explaining pages).
- Success Dance and Pleasure Architecture remain under-defined.
- Council “role map” and “contributions” section still needs a canonical home.
- Decide when to actually run cross-examination rounds and where results will live.

## Notes for future integration
- Publish council prompts as a stable Council resource page (already prepared).
- Create “Council Contributions” folder once Phase 1 begins, so outputs have a home.

## Raw preserved (not published here)
- Full consolidated save and council prompts retained in private archive:
  - session-save-31dec2025-complete.md
  - council-prompts-31dec2025.md
