**Summary:** Strategic decision to foreground Database Builder as primary market identity after recognizing a mismatch between competence and branding.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 3

## Context
Generic "Operations" branding wasn't working. The pivot to "Administrative & Database Specialist" / "Database Builder" matched internal competence maps with external signals.

## Lesson
Build infrastructure (connections, profile polish) before outreach.
