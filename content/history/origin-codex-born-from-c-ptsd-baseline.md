**Summary:** Codex conceived night 05–06 Dec 2025: post-trauma analytical baseline crystallized the Builder identity and turned survival into engineered reconstruction.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 4

## Context
Born from the aftermath of The Wipe, the Catalytic Crisis, and the realization that no one was coming. The default paths were closed by trauma, neglect, and systemic failure. The life that was supposed to be there, wasn't.

## Significance
This wasn't philosophy — it was forged in December's ice, pushing a frozen car, selling what was loved to survive.
