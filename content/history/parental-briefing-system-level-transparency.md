**Summary:** In teens (~age 17), scheduled formal meeting with parents about neurochemical tools, framed as logistics briefing rather than covert operation.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 1

## Context
During medical trauma period (ages 15-18). Strategic disclosure of herbál use framed as a logistics briefing, not a confession.

## Lesson
Asymmetric communication. Transparency and system-level communication can be superior in asymmetric situations. Turn a vulnerability into a controlled demonstration of agency.

## Significance
While most teens hid their stash, you scheduled a meeting with your parents.
