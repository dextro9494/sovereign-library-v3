**Summary:** Acute back pain flare: care-provider recon showed systemic delays. Decision: book future specialist slot, deploy immediate countermeasures, pivot to root cause via mattress procurement.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 2

## Response Layers
1. **Immediate:** Diclofenac gel + heating patches (holding actions)
2. **Near-term:** Booked specialist slot (Jan 21)
3. **Root cause:** Mattress selected (Dibapur RH5 — pending budget after car)

## Status
Mattress researched and selected with Council help, but not ordered yet. Everything comes after the new car next month.
