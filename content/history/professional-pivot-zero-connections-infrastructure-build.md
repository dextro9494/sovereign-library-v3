**Summary:** Encountered 'zero connections' wall; chose two-phase build: foundation first, then outreach.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 2

## Strategy
1. **Phase 1:** Build foundation (30–50 connections, polish profile)
2. **Phase 2:** Strategic outreach

## Status
Building connections step by step. Accepted and pending connections are all relevant — recruiters or from places where applications were submitted.
