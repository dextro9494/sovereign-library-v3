**Summary:** Reframed fragmented work history (SAP coordination + logistics agency chaos) into a coherent bridge narrative: Operations & Systems Specialist / Builder.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 6

## The Problem
Fragmented work history looked like chaos — logistics agency roles, SAP coordination, various positions.

## The Solution
Bridge narrative: all of it was Operations & Systems work. The scattered pieces tell a coherent story when properly framed.

## Result
Pride and forward momentum.
