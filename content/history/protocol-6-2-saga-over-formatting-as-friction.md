**Summary:** Over-formatting in live chat became a diagnostic case study. Fix was precise operational definition (Tone Directive + Safety Lock), not more rules.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 3

## The Problem
AIs were using Codex-style formatting (headers, bullets, structured blocks) in conversational responses. Too heavy. Created friction.

## The Solution
- Hard boundary between Live Chat Mode and Codex Mode
- First-Response Safety Lock: AI must acknowledge mode
- Tone Directive: conversational, strategic-advisor tone

## Lesson
More rules wasn't the answer. Precise operational definition was.
