# Sovereign Library v2 — Session Save (István + ChatGPT Chief Archivist)
**Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Purpose:** Portable save file for continuing work in a new chat (with ChatGPT + Claude).

---

## 0) North Star
- **Library can be grand** (holds everything, can be huge).
- **Mirror + Third Layer must stay clean** (executable, reality-bound).
- Full rework means: **build v2 in parallel** and only cut over at the end.

---

## 1) What we decided (non-negotiables)
1. **Do NOT overwrite v1 during the rebuild.**
2. Build a **new GitHub repo** and deploy it as a separate site while v2 is under construction.
3. The Library becomes “grandiose-safe” via structural primitives:
   - **Backlinks** (“Referenced by”)
   - **Tags taxonomy + tag index**
   - Clear separation of Library vs Mirror template vs Third Layer receipts
4. Preferred workflow: **local build → `/docs` → `git push`** (easy GitHub Pages).

---

## 2) Current live sites
- **v1 (kept intact):** `https://dextro9494.github.io/sovereign-library/`
- **v2 (staging, live):** `https://dextro9494.github.io/sovereign-library-v3/`

---

## 3) Repos and local paths
- Local v2 folder:  
  `C:\Users\Gebruiker\Desktop\Codex\GitHub\sovereign-library-v3`
- GitHub repo:  
  `https://github.com/dextro9494/sovereign-library-v3`

---

## 4) What we implemented (completed)
### 4.1 v2 deployment plumbing
- v2 repo created on GitHub (initially private → made public to enable Pages for free).
- GitHub Pages enabled and working: **site is live**.
- Publishing approach: **build output committed into `/docs`**.

### 4.2 Backlinks (“Referenced by”)
- Updated `layouts/_default/single.html` to add a backlinks section that scans all pages and lists those whose `connected:` includes the current page.
- Result:
  - Outgoing: **Connected to**
  - Incoming: **Referenced by**

### 4.3 baseURL corrected for v2
- `config.toml` updated:
  - `baseURL = "https://dextro9494.github.io/sovereign-library-v3/"`

### 4.4 Tags taxonomy + visible navigation
- Created `content/tags/_index.md`
- Created taxonomy template at `layouts/tags/taxonomy.html`
  - (Originally placed in `content/tags/taxonomy.html` by mistake → fixed by moving it to `layouts/`)
- Added Tags to navbar in `config.toml`:
  ```toml
  [[menu.main]]
  name = "Tags"
  url = "/tags/"
  weight = 90
  ```
- Tags page:
  - `https://dextro9494.github.io/sovereign-library-v3/tags/`
- Needed a hard refresh once due to caching.

### 4.5 System “Connections Index” starter (manual)
- Created: `content/system/connections-index.md`
- You completed this **without** adding it to the menu (step 2 was skipped).

### 4.6 Git milestone tag
- Added and pushed git tag:
  - `v2-start`

---

## 5) Commands we used (for continuity)
### Build + publish
```bash
hugo -d docs
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
git push
```

### Fix push rejection (non-fast-forward)
```bash
git pull --rebase
git push
```

### Add milestone tag
```bash
git tag -a v2-start -m "v2 repo created; v1 scaffold copied; Pages working"
git push --tags
```

### Local preview
```bash
hugo server
```

---

## 6) Known gotchas we hit (and fixed)
1. **GitHub Pages for private repo requires paid plan.**  
   Fix: make repo public → Pages free.
2. **Tags template placed in `content/` caused Hugo build error** (“unmarshal failed”).  
   Fix: move to `layouts/tags/taxonomy.html`.
3. **Navbar changes not visible immediately** due to cache.  
   Fix: hard refresh (Ctrl+F5).

---

## 7) Inputs already shared / processed in this work
- v1 site snapshot: `sovereign-library.zip`
- Codex versions: `Codex v1-v7.zip`
- Claude session recaps: `Session recaps.zip`

---

## 8) Artifacts previously generated (if needed again)
Earlier in this work we produced drop-in zips:
- `codex-evolution-dropin.zip`
- `v2-control-panel-dropin.zip`

If you don’t have them saved locally, we can regenerate them in the new chat using the same uploaded sources.

---

## 9) What remains (next steps, in the right order)
### Phase A — Lock v2 governance (prevents drift)
1. Create a **Rework Control Panel** page in v2 (derived from session recaps):
   - non-negotiables
   - canonical vocabulary
   - deprecated labels
   - open decisions (only blockers)
   - ingestion rules + statuses (`canonical | working | raw | receipt`)
2. Add `content/system/_index.md` (so `/system/` is browsable and becomes the v2 “control room”).

### Phase B — Mirror + Third Layer (clean executables)
3. Add **Mirror Template** page (schema only, publish-safe):
   - Today (date/mode/baseline)
   - Threats/Objectives/Blockers
   - Next 3 actions (always)
   - Pointers (max 5)
   - Crisis mode pointers (2–3)
4. Add **Third Layer rules + receipts model**:
   - Project cards: Definition of Done + Next action
   - Receipts/milestones become the “proof” log
   - Tiny update rhythm (keeps it lived)

### Phase C — Ingest heavy sources (7 batches) into v2 without sludge
5. Upload the **7 batches zip** (batch_1..batch_7).
6. Extract into:
   - nodes/pages
   - connections
   - tag seeds
   - drift-check vs Codex Evolution

### Phase D — Final cutover (only at the end)
7. When v2 is coherent:
   - optionally rename v2 repo to `sovereign-library` to keep your main URL
   - archive v1 repo (recommended)

---

## 10) Definition of Done for v2 readiness
v2 is ready to replace v1 when:
- System hubs exist and are consistent
- Mirror template is executable and stable
- Third Layer is proof-driven
- Tags + backlinks make navigation fast
- Codex Evolution controls drift
- Raw batches have been mined into nodes without bloating navigation

---

## 11) Copy/paste for the next chat with Claude
- v2 is live and v1 is preserved.
- We implemented backlinks + tags taxonomy + fixed baseURL for v2.
- Next: Rework Control Panel + System hub + Mirror template + Third Layer rules.
- Then ingest 7 batches with status/tags/backlinks to avoid sludge.
