# Sovereign Library v2 — Comprehensive Session Save
**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Participants:** István · ChatGPT (Chief Archivist)

---

## 0. Purpose of this file
This document captures **everything achieved, decided, and stabilized in this chat**, so it can be shared with other AIs (DeepSeek, Claude) without re-deriving context.

This is a **stage‑closure save**, not a brainstorming log.

---

## 1. High‑level outcome (one sentence)
A parallel **v2 Sovereign Library** was successfully built, stabilized, and governance‑locked so the Library can grow large while Mirror and Third Layer remain clean, executable, and drift‑resistant.

---

## 2. Architectural model (final, locked)

### 2.1 The Three Layers
**Library (public, can be grand)**
- Holds knowledge, history, patterns, protocols, receipts, raw material
- May grow large without collapse
- Retrieval via tags + backlinks
- Does NOT run the day

**Mirror (template stored, instance paste‑only)**
- Lean session bootloader
- Always resolves to Next 3 Actions
- Template is publish‑safe
- Daily instance stays offsite unless explicitly decided otherwise

**Third Layer (lived proof)**
- Projects become real only through receipts
- No aspirational dashboards
- Definition of Done + Next Action + Receipts required

---

## 3. What was actually built and verified live

### 3.1 Repository & deployment
- New repo created: `sovereign-library-v3`
- v1 preserved untouched
- GitHub Pages enabled and live
- Publishing flow locked:
  ```bash
  hugo -d docs
  git add -A
  git commit -m "..."
  git push
  ```

### 3.2 Retrieval infrastructure (critical upgrade)
- `connected:` links preserved
- **Backlinks (“Referenced by”) implemented and verified**
- **Tags taxonomy created, indexed, and added to nav**
- Manual **Connections Index** page added

Result: Library is now **grandiose‑safe**.

---

## 4. Governance & orientation (missing pieces closed)

The following canonical hubs were added and verified online:

### System
- `/system/` — orientation hub
- Explains layers, usage, normal vs crisis mode

### Governance
- Rework Control Panel
- Decision Map
- Non‑negotiables, vocabulary locks, ingestion rules

### Mirror
- `/mirror/` — template only
- Schema for session bootloader
- Clear rules (always Next 3 Actions)

### Third Layer
- `/third-layer/` — proof‑based rules
- Receipts definition
- Project card minimum

### History
- `/history/codex-evolution/` landing page
- Codex lineage explicitly acknowledged

All links confirmed live and working.

---

## 5. Legacy data ingestion (Batch 1–7)

### What was done
- All 7 legacy chat batches ingested as **raw**
- Stored under History → Legacy Batches
- Nothing canonized accidentally

### Extraction system created
- System → Extraction:
  - Extraction checklist (worklist)
  - Tag seeds
  - Connection suggestions
- CSV + JSON exports generated for automation

Result:
- Nothing lost
- Canonization deliberately deferred

---

## 6. What was *intentionally* deferred
These are **not missing**, they are **parked**:

- Applying `status:` everywhere
- Turning many extraction items into canonical pages
- Heavy refactors or navigation changes

Reason:
- Architecture is complete
- System should now be *used*, not rebuilt

---

## 7. Current state classification
**Status:** 🟢 Architecture complete · Operationally ready

- No structural debt
- No hidden drift
- Safe to pause for weeks and return cold
- Safe to run parallel work (DeepSeek, Claude)

---

## 8. Recommended freeze action
(Optional but smart)

```bash
git tag -a v2-architecture-complete -m "v2 architecture complete and stable"
git push --tags
```

Purpose: future rollback + psychological closure.

---

## 9. How to brief another AI (copy/paste)

> We finished a full v2 rebuild of the Sovereign Library.
> Library can now grow large safely (tags + backlinks).
> Mirror and Third Layer are clean, executable, and governed.
> Legacy data (7 batches) is preserved as raw with extraction tooling.
> Architecture is frozen; next phase is usage and selective canonization.

---

## 10. Next phase (when ready, not now)
- Pick one extraction item
- Turn it into one canonical page
- Let backlinks light up naturally

No further system work required.

---

## 11. Final archivist note
This session ended at the **correct stopping point**.
Anything added now should be *content or evidence*, not structure.

End of save.
