# Session Save — Sovereign Library v3 Build + Finance Baseline
**Date:** 2026-01-15 (Europe/Amsterdam)  
**Context:** This chat session established v3 direction, integration philosophy, and began Finance tracking with real numbers.

---

## 1) Locked Decisions

### 1.1 v3 is a new lineage and the active library
- v3 will be the **single unified library** going forward.
- **No permanent v1/v2 folders** in the final state.
- All content + context from v1/v2 must be **ingested into v3** (not merely referenced by links back to v2).
- Goal: preserve the integrity of backlinks and the knowledge graph.

### 1.2 v3 top-level menu (locked)
**Home · Library · Mirror · Life Layer · Council · Finance · Tags**

### 1.3 Core architectural rule (locked)
**Separation of surfaces, not separation of truth.**  
Different sections are different “views” into one knowledge graph.

### 1.4 Council has a dual role (locked)
- **Council → Start Here**: onboarding for AI/external intelligence + boundaries + where to begin.
- **Council → Insights**: provenance/methodology/governance/attribution logs.  
**Constitution:** Director decides. Council provides intelligence. Never reverse this.

### 1.5 Home page message (locked)
Home must retain the boundary message:  
**“You are here uninvited, but since you are here…”**  
Tone target: “I’m giving you advice for free; take it or shove it.”

### 1.6 Finance is first-class and public-safe (locked)
- Finance will be a **top-level menu** item.
- Finance will store **numbers, categories, and general store names** (e.g., Jumbo, Kaufland, Action).
- No receipts, no itemized purchases, no timestamps, no payment methods.

### 1.7 Finance supports Expected vs Actual vs Delta (locked)
- Each period can include **Expected** (pre), **Actual** (post), and **Delta** (observations only, not judgment).

### 1.8 Finance “month” is salary-cycle based (locked)
A “financial month” is defined by **salary arrival**, not calendar months.
Naming convention:
- **First Cycle:** `2025.12.23` (salary arrival date)
- **Second Cycle:** `2026.01.26/27` (expected next salary arrival date)
Alternative short names allowed: **Cycle 1 / Cycle 2**.

## 2) v3 Build Artifacts Produced This Session

Two files were generated earlier in this session:
- `sovereign-library-v3-blueprint.md`
- `sovereign-library-v3-starter-pack.zip` (Hugo-ready skeleton)

If downloads fail, core contents were also pasted inline in chat.

---

## 3) v3 Integration Strategy (updated requirement)

### 3.1 Non-negotiable
- v3 must contain **everything** from v1 and v2: no context loss.
- Do not keep v1/v2 as separate folders long-term.
- Do not rely on “go read v2 here” links.

### 3.2 Safe approach (agreed direction)
1) Finish the v3 shell so it builds.
2) Bulk-ingest all v2 content into v3 **untouched** (mechanical import).
3) Run a **link integrity pass** (aliases/redirects or rewrite pass if needed).
4) Only then “re-house” content into surfaces (Library/Mirror/Life/Council/Finance), without deleting anything.

## 5) What was explicitly deferred (no planning yet)
- No budgeting rules.
- No allocation decisions.
- No investment activation decision.
- DeGiro usage remains “prepared, not active” until the user says “we are ready”.

---

## 6) Next-session entry point

### 6.1 Confirm the ingestion constraint
- v3 becomes the unified library containing everything from v1/v2.
- Decide preferred migration mechanics (bulk copy + link integrity pass).

### 6.2 Finance: convert to Cycle format
- Create **Cycle 1 (2025.12.23)** page containing all entries in that salary cycle.
- Keep Expected vs Actual blocks for Cycle 2.

### 6.3 Continue Finance capture (optional)
- Add any missing expenses for Cycle 1.
- Add any additional income components if discovered.

---

## 7) One-line “state” for AI onboarding
Building v3 as a unified library that ingests all v1/v2 content (no loss, no external references); finance tracking begins at baseline zero with salary-cycle periods and store-level totals.
