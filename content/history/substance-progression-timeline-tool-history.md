**Summary:** Mapped progression: tobacco early teens; alcohol social; herbál betrayal/medical escape; weed modulation/ROI decline; mushrooms in stasis; Xanax rejected.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 4

## Framing
Not "use" — tool deployment history. Each substance had a function, an ROI, and eventually a decommission decision.

## Key Insight
The operational style is telling: while most teens hid their stash, you scheduled a meeting with your parents.

## Status
Historical log. Current deployment governed by RCP.
