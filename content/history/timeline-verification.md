**Summary:** A verified timeline (Nov 25 → end of Dec 2025) used to correct date drift across entries.

## Purpose
- Prevent “date hallucinations” across tools and sessions.
- Keep the Library grounded.

## Where to update next
If any entry’s date is uncertain, run Temporal Alignment Verification and update here.
