**Summary:** Recognized Codex scaling limits and initiated v7.0 overhaul: dual-layer architecture (Core + Archive) and legacy integration workflow.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 7

## Why It Happened
- 15-page soft cap identified as unsustainable
- System was too heavy to use
- Core and Archive became entangled

## The Solution
Dual-layer architecture: separate the blade (Core for acting) from the library (Archive for remembering).

## What Led to v8.0
v7.0 fragmented because it tried to force two different functions into one system. The v8.0 breakthrough: Library (storage) + Mirror (operational) + Third Layer (living).
