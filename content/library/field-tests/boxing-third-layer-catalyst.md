**Summary:** Boxing together is treated as a Third Layer catalyst: shared practice that converts plans into lived reality.

## Why it matters
- Shared physical training = real-world territory.
- Builds coordination, confidence, and embodied stability.

## Practical notes
- Gear list + budget tracked.
- Start date adjusted based on budget/timing reality (see daily capsules for the latest).
