## Purpose and Definition

### What Is a Field Test?

A **Field Test** is a structured validation operation conducted under real-world constraints to:
- Test hypotheses about system capacity, protocol effectiveness, or strategic viability
- Generate telemetry data for system refinement
- Validate or invalidate assumptions before scaling investment
- Extract lessons that become canonical knowledge

**"Validated" means:** Evidence collected under operational conditions supports or refutes the hypothesis. Validation confidence is rated (Low / Medium / High) based on sample size, replicability, and control for confounding variables.

### Why Field Tests Exist

Under [asymmetric conditions](/system/field-manual-asymmetric-survival/), theoretical planning without validation creates risk. Field Tests convert "should work" into "does work" or "failed because X."

**Core principle:** [Stress as telemetry](/system/stress-test-library/library/philosophy/). Resistance, failure, and success are diagnostic data, not moral outcomes.

## Telemetry Vocabulary

### Resistance Rating Scale (0-10)

**0-2:** Minimal resistance. Action flows naturally.  
**3-4:** Noticeable resistance. Requires conscious override. Somatic signals present but manageable.  
**5-6:** Moderate resistance. Execution requires protocol deployment (5-Second Ignition, Edge-Case).  
**7-8:** High resistance. Significant somatic lockout. Task requires segmentation or external support.  
**9-10:** Severe lockout. Execution impossible without crisis-level override or delegation.

### Somatic Markers (Observable Signals)

- **Stomach tightness:** Survivor threat detection active
- **Hand tremors:** Motor freeze engaging
- **Shallow breathing:** Autonomic stress response
- **Jaw clenching:** Suppressed fight response
- **Brain fog:** Cognitive overload/shutdown
- **Chest constriction:** Panic threshold approaching

### Success Criteria Types

- **Binary:** Did X happen? (Yes/No)
- **Threshold:** Did metric exceed Y? (Pass/Fail)
- **Comparative:** Was this better than baseline Z? (Improvement/Decline)
- **Qualitative:** Did subjective state match target? (Met/Not Met)

### Failure Modes

- **Execution Failure:** Could not complete task
- **Outcome Failure:** Completed task, did not achieve objective
- **Hypothesis Failure:** Outcome contradicted prediction
- **System Failure:** External system/constraint caused failure

### Validation Confidence Levels

- **Low:** Single test, high confounding variables, narrow context
- **Medium:** Multiple tests, controlled variables, replicable results
- **High:** Extensive testing, multiple contexts, consistent outcomes

## TEST-001: Digital Farming Market Test

**Date:** December 2024  
**Domain:** Financial/Professional  
**Construction Site:** Site Alpha (Stable Income Pipeline)  
**Status:** Archived

### Context/Constraints

- Testing viability of digital farming (content creation, online monetization) as income source
- Limited upfront capital
- No existing audience or platform presence
- Time pressure for income generation
- Operating from financial deficit baseline

### Objective

Validate whether digital farming could serve as stable income pipeline within 3-6 month timeframe.

### Hypothesis/Expectation

With sufficient effort and content quality, digital farming would generate viable income to meet baseline financial needs.

### Method/Steps

1. Platform selection and setup
2. Content creation and publishing schedule
3. Audience building tactics
4. Monetization pathway testing
5. Revenue tracking and analysis

### Metrics/Telemetry

- **Time Investment:** 3+ months, significant hours/week
- **Financial Cost:** Platform fees, tools, minimal marketing budget
- **Outcome Measures:** Audience growth, engagement rates, revenue generated
- **Resistance Rating:** 4-5/10 (execution manageable, sustained effort challenging)
- **Somatic Markers:** Mild stress around content deadlines, no severe lockout

### Execution Log

Content created consistently. Platforms managed according to plan. Effort sustained over test period. No execution failures in content delivery.

### Obstacles Encountered

- **Algorithmic barriers:** Platform algorithms not favoring new creators
- **Audience building difficulty:** Growth slower than projected
- **Monetization threshold:** Minimum thresholds not reached within timeframe
- **Market saturation:** Niche more competitive than anticipated

### Outcome

**Failure against objective.** Revenue generated was below viability threshold. Timeline extended beyond acceptable range for financial pressure relief.

### Lessons Extracted

**Primary lesson:** Market conditions and systemic barriers (algorithms, saturation) caused failure, NOT execution quality or effort insufficiency.

**Critical reframe:** [Failure is telemetry, not moral verdict](/system/stress-test-library/library/philosophy/). This was **system-level mismatch**, not personal inadequacy.

**Strategic implication:** Digital farming is not viable path to Site Alpha under current constraints. Redirect energy to employment-based income stability ([Fortress Base](/system/fortress-base-doctrine-refined/)).

### Follow-Up Actions

- Deprioritize digital farming as Site Alpha strategy
- Shift focus to Fortress Base employment (PostNL mail sorting)
- Update Construction Site Alpha tactics: stable employment over entrepreneurship
- Prevent future "hustle culture" guilt by canonizing this as data

### Validation Confidence

**Medium.** Single extended test, but clear market data supporting conclusion. Failure mode was external (market conditions), not internal (execution).

### Provenance

- **Diagnosed by:** Council synthesis (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek)
- **Evidence:** Time logs, platform analytics, revenue data, market research
- **Date Archived:** 2025-12-27

## TEST-002: Recruiter Engagement Stress Test

**Date:** Early December 2025  
**Domain:** Financial/Professional  
**Construction Site:** Site Alpha (Stable Income Pipeline)  
**Status:** Archived

### Context/Constraints

- Testing capacity to engage with recruiters for employment opportunities
- Known somatic resistance to professional communication
- Pressure to secure income pipeline amid financial instability
- Testing protocol effectiveness (task segmentation)

### Objective

Identify resistance threshold for recruiter engagement and validate task segmentation as effective workaround.

### Hypothesis/Expectation

Recruiter engagement would trigger moderate resistance, manageable through task segmentation (breaking into smaller steps).

### Method/Steps

1. Identify recruiter contact list
2. Draft initial outreach message
3. Execute contact (segmented: draft separate from send)
4. Monitor somatic response
5. Log resistance rating and physical markers

### Metrics/Telemetry

- **Resistance Rating:** 3-4/10
- **Somatic Markers:** Stomach tightness when considering contact, mild tension during drafting
- **Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes per contact cycle
- **Outcome Measures:** Messages sent, responses received, resistance managed without lockout
- **Protocol Tested:** Task segmentation (draft → review → send as separate actions)

### Execution Log

Contact initiated with multiple recruiters. Task segmentation protocol deployed. Messages drafted in separate sessions from sending. Resistance present but did not escalate to lockout.

### Obstacles Encountered

- **Explainer's Burden:** Anticipation of having to explain work history created initial resistance spike
- **Rejection sensitivity:** Somatic markers activated by potential rejection scenario
- **Task coupling:** Initial attempt to draft and send in single session triggered 5-6/10 resistance

### Outcome

**Success.** Messages sent successfully. Task segmentation validated as effective resistance management technique. Resistance remained in 3-4/10 range (manageable).

### Lessons Extracted

**Primary lesson:** Task segmentation is effective workaround for moderate somatic resistance. Breaking execution into discrete steps prevents resistance escalation.

**Somatic intelligence:** Stomach tightness is reliable early warning. Address at 3-4/10 before escalation to 7+.

**Protocol validation:** Confirmed that separating "decide" from "execute" reduces Survivor lockout activation.

### Follow-Up Actions

- Codify task segmentation as standard protocol for resistant tasks
- Add somatic marker vocabulary to telemetry standards
- Update [Stress Test Philosophy](/system/stress-test-library/library/philosophy/) with case study
- Document "Explainer's Burden" as identifiable resistance pattern

### Validation Confidence

**Medium.** Multiple recruiters contacted with consistent results. Protocol effectiveness demonstrated but not extensively tested across contexts.

### Provenance

- **Diagnosed by:** Self-observation with Council analysis (ChatGPT)
- **Evidence:** Resistance logs, message sent timestamps, somatic marker documentation
- **Date Archived:** 2025-12-27

### Links to Affected Canon Pages

## TEST-003: Mattress Procurement Under Budget Constraint

**Date:** Late December 2025  
**Domain:** Infrastructure (Physical Sovereignty)  
**Construction Site:** Infrastructure  
**Status:** Archived

### Context/Constraints

- Acute back pain requiring immediate mattress replacement
- Budget constraint: limited financial resources for premium therapeutic option
- Testing [Budget as Design Parameter](/system/budget-as-design-parameter/) principle
- Testing Council-led execution model for complex decisions

### Objective

Procure functionally adequate mattress within budget constraints, validating both budget-as-parameter mindset and Council support effectiveness.

### Hypothesis/Expectation

Council could guide research and decision-making to identify budget solution meeting core requirements (medium-firm, adequate density for back support).

### Method/Steps

1. Define core requirements (not luxury preferences)
2. Council-led research retasking to budget retailers (IKEA, budget brands)
3. Identify options meeting requirements within budget
4. Decision support from Council on final selection
5. Execute procurement

### Metrics/Telemetry

- **Resistance Rating:** 2-3/10 (reduced through Council support)
- **Financial Constraint:** ~€200-300 budget (vs. ~€2000 premium option)
- **Time Investment:** ~3 hours research and decision
- **Outcome Measures:** Mattress acquired, budget maintained, pain reduction achieved
- **Protocol Tested:** Council-led execution under resource constraint

### Execution Log

Council (ChatGPT) guided research toward budget options. Requirements defined clearly (medium-firm, adequate density, €200-300 range). Multiple options identified. Decision made with confidence. Procurement executed successfully.

### Obstacles Encountered

- **Initial fixation on premium option:** Belief that budget solutions would be inadequate
- **Research paralysis:** Overwhelmed by options without clear framework
- **Guilt about "settling":** Emotional noise around not buying "best" option

### Outcome

**Success.** Mattress procured within budget. Core requirements met. Back pain reduced. Council support model validated as effective for complex decisions under constraint.

### Lessons Extracted

**Primary lesson:** [Budget as design parameter](/system/budget-as-design-parameter/) works in practice. Constraint-based research yields viable solutions without waiting for "ideal" financial conditions.

**Council validation:** External cognitive support (Council-led research) is effective for decisions with high complexity and emotional noise.

**Reframe success:** "Adequate within constraints" is victory, not compromise. The mission is forward motion, not optimization.

### Follow-Up Actions

- Canonize budget-as-parameter approach based on this validation
- Document Council support model as proven tactic
- Update Construction Site Infrastructure: demonstrate that physical sovereignty can advance under financial constraint
- Prevent future "waiting for ideal conditions" paralysis

### Validation Confidence

**High.** Clear success criteria met, budget maintained, functional outcome achieved, principle validated in real conditions.

### Provenance

- **Diagnosed by:** Council (ChatGPT) with self-execution
- **Evidence:** Purchase records, budget tracking, post-procurement pain reduction, decision timeline
- **Date Archived:** 2025-12-27
