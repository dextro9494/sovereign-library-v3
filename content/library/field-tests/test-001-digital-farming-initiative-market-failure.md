**Summary:** Pre-Codex, large-scale asymmetric economic maneuver terminated by market failure. Validated need for stable pipeline (Site Alpha).

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 1–2

## Context
Started with Grok (Nov 28) after car was fixed. TikTok/Gmail account warming/farming.

## Outcome
Market failure by Nov 29 — invalid links, spam filters, no reliable pipeline.

## Lesson
Sheer operational grit is insufficient against broken external systems. This failure, as part of the Catalytic Crisis, directly precipitated the development of the Sovereign Master Codex.
