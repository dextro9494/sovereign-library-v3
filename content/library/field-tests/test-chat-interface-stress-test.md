## What Was Tested
Interface and protocol integrity under meta-engagement (Operator interrogating the system itself).

## Result
SUCCESS. System correctly interpreted meta-engagement as a test.

## Significance
Validates the Council's "Director of Intelligence" model. The Operator can interrogate the system without breaking operational mode.
