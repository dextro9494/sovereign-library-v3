**Summary:** Identified 15-page soft cap as unsustainable constraint; triggered v7.0 architecture evolution.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 7

## Finding
Codex Operational Core had a 15-page soft cap. Breaching it created bloat and friction.

## Response
Triggered v7.0 overhaul — dual-layer architecture (Core + Archive).

## Further Evolution
v7.0 fragmented → v8.0 breakthrough: Library + Mirror + Third Layer.
