**Summary:** Tremor/tightness is treated as firmware telemetry: the Survivor's neuro-physiological lockout marker. Not fear to be argued with, but a signal to be handled with protocol.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 1, 3, 4

## Notes
- Keep this as a "card" unless you're expanding with raw excerpts.
- When expanding, add 1–3 concrete examples and link back to the relevant protocol.
