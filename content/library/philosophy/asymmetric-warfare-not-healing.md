**Summary:** Foundational decision: treat life reconstruction as asymmetric warfare against a 31-year deficit, not 'healing'. Victory is a managed, sovereign life.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 4–5

## Core Principle
You are not building from zero. You are building from a 31-year deficit, on ground that is still settling. Therefore, conventional methods will fail. Your strategy must be asymmetric, ingenious, and sovereign.

## Victory Defined
A managed, sovereign life: financial safety, professional autonomy, personal enjoyment.
