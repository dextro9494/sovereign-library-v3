**Summary:** Personal enjoyment is treated as a legitimate asset line item, not a reward. Example: tangible 'sovereign enjoyment' vehicle goal.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 1, 3

## Principle
Enjoyment is not a reward to be earned after sovereignty is achieved. It's an asset class that gets allocated like any other.

## Example
The 2001 BMW 320i Executive — a tangible line item for sovereign enjoyment.

## Connection to Third Layer
The Library and Mirror exist to serve the Third Layer — which is lived, not stored. Boxing, games, her singing. The things that aren't about survival.
