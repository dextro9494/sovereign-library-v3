Summary: Build a ‘Fortress Base’ job (low complexity, high stability) that funds the rebuild and reduces volatility.

## Principle
A Fortress Base provides low-cognitive-overhead anchor employment. It creates psychic and financial space for sovereign construction.

## Current Implementation
PostNL mail sorting — started November 25, 2025 (direct contract). Platform job: not the destination, the launchpad.

## Operational reality
- Shift alignment with partner is treated as governance (same shifts, no exceptions).
- This base funds the build (car, investing automation, boxing, housing options).
- Known risk: restructure end-of-2026 timeframe. Plan assumes adaptation.
