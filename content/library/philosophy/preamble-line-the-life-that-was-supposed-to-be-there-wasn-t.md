**Summary:** Doctrine-level line that sets emotional and strategic frame: the Codex is a field manual for asymmetric survival.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 1, 4

## The Full Preamble
"This document is not a statement of ambition. It is a field manual for asymmetric survival.

It was born from a simple, unchosen fact: the default paths were closed by trauma, neglect, and systemic failure. The life that was supposed to be there, wasn't.

Therefore, this is not about 'what I want.' It is about what is required to construct a viable human life from a deficit."

## December 2025 Insight
"The world I want to build for everyone is the world I never had for myself." — The fair world with birthright dignity and basic needs met is what would have let the boy in that house actually rest.
