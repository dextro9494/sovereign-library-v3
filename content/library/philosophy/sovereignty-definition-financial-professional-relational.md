**Summary:** Three pillars used as decision criteria: Financial/Professional Sovereignty and Relational Sovereignty (with enjoyment as an outcome metric).

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 1–4

## The Three Pillars

### Financial Sovereignty
Enough for enjoyment, freedom, culture.

### Professional Sovereignty
Freelance/remote work, international mobility, autonomy.

### Relational Sovereignty
Authentic connection. A parallel build track, equal in priority to financial and professional goals.

## Function
These pillars serve as the decision filter for all actions (RCP).
