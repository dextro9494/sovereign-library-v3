**Summary:** v8 separates the system into three distinct layers so the system stays usable: the Library holds, the Mirror operates, the Third Layer is lived.

## The Library (this site)
Holds everything you know: principles, patterns, protocols, history. It does not try to *run* your day. It holds weight outside your head.

## The Mirror
The operational layer: what’s active now, what matters now, what is true now. Lean, current, portable. This is what gets pasted into sessions. It’s intentionally small.

## The Third Layer
What becomes possible when the Library holds the weight and the Mirror shows the truth. Not primarily documented. Lived in practice (e.g., boxing together, real-world building, relationships).

## Design rule
The Library must never become the operating system. That was v7’s failure mode.
