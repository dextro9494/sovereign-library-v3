**Summary:** Bypass for Survivor lockout: acknowledge Survivor mode, apply physical cue (sharp exhale + body shake), issue 'Execute Protocol', act within 5 seconds before debate starts.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 1–4

## Procedure
1. **Acknowledge:** "Survivor is engaged. Threat identified."
2. **Cue:** Sharp exhale + body shake
3. **Command:** "Execute."
4. **Action:** Move within 5 seconds — not deciding IF, following the plan already written

## Notes
- The goal is to move with the focused absurdity of a man pushing a frozen car in the dark.
