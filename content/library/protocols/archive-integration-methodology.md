**Summary:** Dedicated workflow: separate execution mode from archiving mode (dedicated chat for legacy integration). Clean separation of concerns keeps velocity high and avoids the extraction swamp.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batch 7

## Principle
Don't mix building with archiving. Use dedicated sessions for legacy integration work.

## Rationale
Operational execution takes precedence over architectural refinement. If uncertain whether to update the Codex or execute a protocol, execute first.
