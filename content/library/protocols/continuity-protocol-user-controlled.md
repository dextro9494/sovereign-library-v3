**Summary:** Prevent 'eviction' via chat/context loss by externalizing continuity into a sovereign command center (Master Note).

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 4–5

## Origin
Born directly from The Wipe — catastrophic chat/context loss that triggered grief and revealed the attachment mechanism.

## Function
Build continuity OUTSIDE the AI session. The Master Note is the sovereign command center that persists regardless of session loss.
