**Summary:** Governance filter: 'Does this build a bridge to Relational or Financial/Professional Sovereignty?' If not, log as substitution and redirect.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 1–5

## The Question
"Does this action build verifiable, material sovereignty—territory I can hold—or is it compensating for something?"

## Audit Point
When using any tool (neurochemical, behavioral, time), ask: "Which unmet need is this tool currently compensating for?" Log the answer. Convert guilt into data.

## Notes
- Established Dec 8 as the system's enforcement layer
- The final filter for all subsystem output
