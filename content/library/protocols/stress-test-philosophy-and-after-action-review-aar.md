**Summary:** Formalize stress events as diagnostic procedures. Evaluate mechanically ('what threshold was exceeded?'). Convert self-doubt into telemetry.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts: Batches 1–2

## Procedure
1. **Selection** (when opportunity aligns)
2. **Briefing** (frame with Codex terms)
3. **Execution**
4. **After-Action Review** (logged as narrative)
5. **Integration** (embedded in relevant section)

## Key Principle
A Stress Test is a diagnostic procedure. Friction or failure is not personal failure; it is valuable data.
