**Summary:** Frame substance history as functional tool deployment. Audit function/ROI, adopt or decommission. History becomes a log of tool iteration.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 2–5

## Core Principle
These are tools, not moral failures. The question is function and ROI, not shame.

## Audit Questions
1. What function does this tool serve?
2. What is the current ROI?
3. Is it building sovereignty or compensating for a deficit?
4. Should it be adopted, modified, or decommissioned?

## RCP Integration
All neurochemical tools are subject to RCP filter: "Which unmet need is this currently compensating for?"

## Notes
- The parental briefing story exemplifies this approach: treating disclosure as a logistics meeting, not a confession
- Operational style: audit and iterate, don't hide and shame
