**Summary:** Run two parallel tracks: long-term investing and an emergency buffer. Automate both.

## Bucket A: Long-term
- Recurring investment into a broad ETF (e.g., VWCE) via automation.

## Bucket B: Emergency buffer
- Separate emergency savings target range.
- Keeps shocks from becoming existential.

## Rule
Start small, automate early, refine later.
