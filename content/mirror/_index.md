# Mirror Template (publish-safe)

The Mirror is the operational bootloader for sessions.  
This page stores the **template** only. The live daily Mirror instance is paste-only/offsite by default.

## Mirror Schema (lean)
Copy/paste this block into a new session and fill it.

```text

## Rules
- The Mirror must always end with **Next 3 Actions**.
- Keep pointers short. No browsing during crisis.
- If you can’t decide: choose one stabilizing action and do it.
