Summary: Provides domestic stability through chosen presence, not supervision. Co-builder in practical projects. Trust-based partnership (no surveillance). The bond is love, closeness, and co-creation, not “lifeboat” dynamics.

## Context
Together since 10 May 2019. She knows everything that matters.

## How we operate (treaty)
- She doesn’t read the Council chats directly unless I show her something.
- I share what’s relevant. She shares her read of reality.
- Partnership without secrecy, without surveillance.

## Function
- Domestic stability partner (presence-based support)
- Co-conspirator on practical projects
- Social connector (reads people, gathers signals)
- Reflects me in a way I can actually receive

## Third Layer Connection
Boxing together as a Third Layer catalyst.
- Originally planned for early January 2026
- Updated plan: start around ~January 20, 2026 (budget/timing reality)
