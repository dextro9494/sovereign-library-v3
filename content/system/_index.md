description: "Governance, control panel, and meta-layer documentation"

This section contains the governance layer for the Library:

- **[Rework Control Panel](rework-control-panel/)** - non-negotiables, canonical vocabulary, ingestion rules
- **[Decision Map](decision-map/)** - tracked decisions and open questions  
- **[Connections Index](connections-index/)** - manual relationship map (pre-backlinks implementation)
- **[Analysis](analysis/)** - structural audits, build logs, extraction work

The System layer prevents drift and maintains coherence as the Library scales.
