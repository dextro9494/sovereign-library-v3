This subsection documents the meta-layer of Library development:

## Structural Analysis
- **[v1 Structural Audit](v1_structural_audit/)** - Why v2 rebuild was necessary: missing backlinks, tags index, and governance layer
- **[v2 Build Log](v2_build_log/)** - Implementation details from January 1-2: what was built, issues hit, solutions applied

## Extraction Work  
- **[Council Extraction: v7 Analysis](council_about_v7_structured_extraction/)** - GPT's structured analysis of Codex v7, identifying patterns and connections

These documents serve as drift-prevention and decision archaeology - they show *why* architectural choices were made so future iterations don't repeat solved problems.
