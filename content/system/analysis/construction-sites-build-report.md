## RCP Integration Validation

**Spec requirement:** "Sites must support RCP resource allocation decisions"

**Implementation quality:**

**RCP prompts from spec directly addressed:**
- ✓ "Does this advance Site Alpha?" - Time allocation tree
- ✓ "Does this advance Site Beta?" - Time allocation tree
- ✓ "Does this advance Site Gamma?" - Time allocation tree
- ✓ "Which unmet need is this compensating for?" - Attention allocation tree + symptom mapping

**RCP becomes operational:** ✓ Decision trees provide deterministic routing

**Site definitions enable RCP:** ✓ Clear advancement criteria for each site make "advance" measurable

---

## Intellectual Gaps Filled (From Spec Table)

### Gap 1: RCP needs shared project taxonomy
**Filled:** Site Directory provides canonical taxonomy (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) with clear definitions

### Gap 2: RCP needs Sites to prevent drift
**Filled:** Resource Allocation Matrix provides decision trees that enforce Site-based allocation

### Gap 3: RCP needs relational goals operational
**Filled:** Site Gamma includes measurable criteria (rituals, communication quality, Third Layer status)

### Gap 4: RCP needs diagnostic pivot for compensations
**Filled:** Unmet Needs section maps symptoms to Sites, Intervention Playbook routes to construction work

### Gap 5: Stress Test needs remediation destination
**Filled:** Field Test Integration section maps lessons to Site updates

### Gap 6: Tool audits need non-moral diagnostic target
**Filled:** Symptom mapping treats tool use as signal → Site deficit, not personal failure

### Gap 7: Tool audits need actionable construction routing
**Filled:** Intervention Playbook provides first-line actions per site deficit

### Gap 8: Live Codex needs canonical active projects
**Filled:** Progress Tracking Schema + Live vs Archive rules provide compact portfolio view

### Gap 9: Parallel Track needs structural pillars
**Filled:** Site Alpha (Professional track) and Site Gamma (Relational track) named as pillars

### Gap 10: Continuity needs at-a-glance portfolio
**Filled:** Progress Tracking Schema with minimal fields designed for Master Note integration

## Deployment Readiness

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-READY

**This page serves as:**
1. Portfolio control structure for sovereignty operations
2. Resource allocation framework (operationalizes RCP)
3. Symptom-to-intervention routing system
4. Progress tracking surface for continuity
5. Field test lesson integration target
6. Diagnostic anchor for tool audit patterns

**Integration with existing canon:**
- RCP now has operational allocation targets
- Tool audits now route to Site interventions
- Field tests now map to Site updates
- Continuity protocol has portfolio tracking surface
- Parallel Track Architecture has named structural pillars

**This is the load-bearing resource allocation infrastructure for the entire Sovereign Library system.**
