## Deployment Readiness

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-READY

**This page serves as:**
1. Evidence locker for AI contributions to Sovereign Library
2. Methodology log for multi-AI synthesis operations
3. Attribution record for transparency and credit
4. Provenance documentation preventing "because AI said so"
5. Governance constitution maintaining Director sovereignty
6. Validation evidence repository with field test links
7. Evolution tracker for framework development
8. Operational guide for Council deployment

**Integration with existing canon:**
- Provides legitimacy for all Council-derived principles
- Documents validation for protocols and patterns
- Tracks architectural evolution (v4.3 → v7.0)
- Establishes reusable consultation model
- Protects sovereignty while leveraging AI intelligence

**This is the transparency infrastructure that makes AI Council a legitimate, bounded, governed tool rather than mystified oracle.**
