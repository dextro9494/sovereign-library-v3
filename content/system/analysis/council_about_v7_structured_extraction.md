# Council about v7 — Structured Extraction (regenerated from this chat)
**Date:** 2026-01-11

This recreates the structured extraction we wrote in-chat after you flagged that **“Council about v7” is 500+ lines and includes all members’ opinions**.

> Note: the extraction below is based on the chat reconstruction; if you want a strict quote-level extraction, re-upload the Codex zip in the new chat and we’ll re-derive it directly.

## What the file contains
1) **Claude** — comprehensive multi-section review (dominant majority of the file)
2) **Grok** — contrarian stress-test (short)
3) **ChatGPT** — addendum (short; appeared truncated in-file)
4) **Archival intelligence perspective** — addendum (short; appeared truncated; ends signed “— ChatGPT”)

## Claude: key themes and patches
### 1) Dual-layer architecture (Core vs Archive)
- Core = action surface (lean, scannable)
- Archive = memory/retrieval weight
- Primary risk: **sync drift**

### 2) Execution vs architecture pressure
- Risk that system-building becomes a high-IQ detour from execution
- Suggested remedies: metrics, freeze conditions, enforceable throttle

### 3) Operational viability improvements
- 5-Second Ignition: add a fallback default micro-action
- RCP: enforce violations with a concrete protocol
- Throttle Clause: make it measurable (consultation-to-execution ratio)
- Add velocity indicators to dashboard (↗ / → / ↘)

### 4) Crisis retrieval friction
- Create **Archive V0** (fast layer):
  - crisis quick-cards
  - master tag index
  - council theme index
- Goal: crisis access time measured in minutes

### 5) Psychological coherence safeguards
- Builder/Survivor model useful but must not ossify (add model-note)
- Self-deception risk: strategic framing can be avoidance (audit protocol)

### 6) Recommended missing canonical stories
- Story 034: BMW acquisition origin
- Story 035: Fiancée integration (co-conspirator validation)
- Story 036: Digital Farming post-mortem

### 7) Freeze condition
- If execution stays yellow/red while Codex keeps expanding: freeze architecture updates for a defined period.

## Grok: contrarian stress-test (as remembered)
- Flags over-engineering and Archive sacred-clutter risk
- Suggests selective pressure (purge/simplification protocols)

---

## ChatGPT / Archival addenda (as remembered)
- Core/Archive split is correct and overdue
- Key archival principle: Operator should not have to relive to act
- Systems built for chaos must recognize calm, or manufacture danger to stay relevant

---

## Implication for v2
This council document is one of the strongest arguments for:
- Big Library allowed, but retrieval must be fast
- Mirror + Third Layer stay executable
- Governance rules must exist to prevent monolith drift
