## Purpose: Why Construction Sites Exist

**Construction Sites are the portfolio control structure for sovereignty-building operations.**

Under [asymmetric conditions](/system/field-manual-asymmetric-survival/), resource scarcity (time, money, attention) demands strategic allocation. Without named build domains, effort disperses into reactive firefighting or compensatory activities.

**Construction Sites provide:**
- **Named targets** for resource allocation decisions
- **Diagnostic anchors** for symptom-to-deficit mapping
- **Progress surfaces** for strategic continuity
- **Intervention routing** from audits to actionable construction work

**This is infrastructure, not motivation.** Sites are architectural units, not aspirational categories.

---

## Definitions and Rules

### What Is a Construction Site?

A **Construction Site** is a named build domain representing a critical sovereignty infrastructure category.

**Not:**
- A to-do list
- A motivational goal
- A personal development theme

**Is:**
- A project portfolio unit with defined scope
- A resource allocation target
- A diagnostic anchor for deficit mapping
- A progress tracking surface

### What Is an Active Site?

An **Active Site** is a Construction Site currently receiving resource investment and strategic attention.

**Status classifications:**
- **Active:** Receiving regular time/resource allocation
- **Maintenance:** Minimum viable input to preserve gains
- **Dormant:** No current investment; stable or deprioritized
- **Threatened:** Under external pressure requiring immediate intervention

### How Sites Relate to RCP

The [Real-World Connection Protocol (RCP)](/system/real-world-connection-filter/) uses Construction Sites as allocation targets.

**RCP prompts reference Sites:**
- "Does this advance Site Alpha (income pipeline)?"
- "Does this build Site Beta (asset base)?"
- "Does this deepen Site Gamma (relational sovereignty)?"
- "Which unmet need from Active Sites is this compensating for?"

**Without Sites, RCP is philosophical. With Sites, RCP is operational.**

## Unmet Needs and Symptom Mapping

**Purpose:** Map compensatory behaviors and neurochemical tool deployment to Site-level deficits.

**Diagnostic principle:** Increased tool use signals unmet Site need, not personal failure. (See [Neurochemical Tool Audit Philosophy](/system/neurochemical-tool-audit-library/library/philosophy/), [Substance Audit Engineering Log](/system/substance-audit-engineering-log/), [Neurochemical Tool Lifecycle](/system/neurochemical-tool-lifecycle/))

### Site Alpha Deficit Symptoms

**When Site Alpha is threatened or neglected:**

**Behavioral signals:**
- Increased dopamine-seeking (scrolling, gaming, novel content consumption)
- Procrastination on professional tasks
- Avoidance of recruiter contact or job search
- Increased caffeine/stimulant use to force function
- Work-related stress dreams

**Somatic signals:**
- Stomach tension when considering employment tasks
- Decision paralysis around career moves
- Financial anxiety spikes
- Survivor lockout on professional communication

**Tool compensation patterns:**
- Cannabis to suppress employment anxiety
- Gaming/content to avoid job search
- Caffeine to maintain Fortress Base function under stress

**Diagnostic conversion:** "I'm procrastinating/anxious" → "Site Alpha needs direct intervention"

### Site Beta Deficit Symptoms

**When Site Beta is threatened or neglected:**

**Behavioral signals:**
- Impulsive spending (seeking control through acquisition)
- Avoidance of financial planning or budget review
- Increased risk-taking or reckless resource use
- Resentment about budget constraints

**Somatic signals:**
- Anxiety about emergency fund depletion
- Shame around debt or financial status
- Panic when unexpected expenses appear

**Tool compensation patterns:**
- Shopping/acquisition to feel progress
- Food/substance use to suppress financial anxiety
- Escapist content to avoid financial reality

**Diagnostic conversion:** "I'm wasting money/avoiding budgets" → "Site Beta needs direct intervention"

### Site Gamma Deficit Symptoms

**When Site Gamma is threatened or neglected:**

**Behavioral signals:**
- Increased isolation or withdrawal
- Work/project obsession that crowds out relational time
- Irritability or conflict with The Fiancée
- Abandonment of rituals or quality time
- Social media scrolling (parasocial substitute)

**Somatic signals:**
- Loneliness despite partnership
- Guilt about relational neglect
- Exhaustion from lack of genuine connection

**Tool compensation patterns:**
- Content consumption as parasocial substitute
- Work addiction to avoid relational vulnerability
- Substance use to suppress isolation pain

**Diagnostic conversion:** "I'm lonely/avoiding connection" → "Site Gamma needs direct intervention"

## Resource Allocation Matrix

**Purpose:** Operationalize [RCP](/system/real-world-connection-filter/) using Construction Sites as decision framework.

### Time Allocation Decision Tree

**When considering time investment:**

1. **Does this advance an Active Construction Site?**
   - Yes, Site Alpha → Proceed (employment/income priority)
   - Yes, Site Beta → Evaluate budget impact first
   - Yes, Site Gamma → Protect (relational sovereignty non-negotiable)
   - No → Question 2

2. **Does this prevent Site regression or threat?**
   - Yes → Proceed as maintenance
   - No → Question 3

3. **Which Site need is this compensating for?**
   - Identify deficit Site
   - Route to Direct Intervention instead
   - Decline compensatory activity

### Money Allocation Decision Tree

**When considering financial expenditure:**

1. **Which Site does this serve?**
   - Site Alpha (employment): Justify as pipeline investment
   - Site Beta (assets): Check emergency fund status first
   - Site Gamma (relational): Budget within discretionary allocation
   - None → Decline

2. **Is this advancement or maintenance?**
   - Advancement: Proceed if Site is Active priority
   - Maintenance: Proceed if necessary to prevent regression
   - Neither → Decline

3. **Can this be achieved within budget constraint?**
   - Yes → Apply [budget-as-parameter](/system/budget-as-design-parameter/)
   - No → Defer or redesign solution

### Attention Allocation Decision Tree

**When attention drift occurs (scrolling, escapism, tool use):**

1. **Which Site is currently neglected or threatened?**
   - Identify deficit Site from symptom mapping
   - Route to Direct Intervention

2. **Is this compensation or genuine rest?**
   - Compensation → Address Site gap
   - Genuine rest → Time-box and permit

3. **Does this build sovereign capacity?**
   - Yes (learning, skill development, genuine connection) → Permit
   - No (passive consumption, avoidance) → Redirect to Site work
