# Decision Map (extracted from `Session recaps.zip`)

## Locked decisions (high confidence)
### Architecture
- v8 = **Library / Mirror / Third Layer** separation.
- v7 fragmentation cause: operational weight + crisis retrieval friction.
- Library build should be **modular**, not one monolithic file.
- Retrieval design: **topic hubs + tags + explicit connections** (“hybrid retrieval system”).

### Continuity
- Keep a **Session Save** document for continuity.
- Use **Council Prompts** + a phased process (Cold Read → Cross-Examination → Synthesis) to prevent single-model tunnel vision.

### Reality anchoring
- **RCP** is a core gate: the system must connect to real-world sovereignty.
- **Throttle** is necessary (avoid consultation replacing execution).

## Important clarifications captured
- Therapy-as-recon protocol exists as **working**, not executed yet (Dec 3 proposal).
- Mattress was selected (Dec 24) but not ordered yet (pending after car).
- Protocol 6.2 saga occurred Dec 25 during fast iteration (v4.7→v6.0.1).
- Premium purchases: Dec 26 for Claude + GPT; LinkedIn Premium earlier (~Dec 14-15).

## Open decisions (true blockers)
- Mirror publication policy in v2:
  - Publish **template only** vs publish live instance.
- Backlinks:
  - Keep current outgoing `connected:` only vs add computed backlinks (recommended later).
- Third Layer representation:
  - Keep it “lived only” vs store “receipt cards” publicly.

## Known truncations / missing completeness
Some recaps contain ellipses or cut lines (e.g., parentheticals, entry-format snippet).
If you have fuller originals, they can replace these recaps later for 1:1 accuracy.
