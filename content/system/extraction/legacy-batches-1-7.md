# Extraction Index: Legacy Batches 1–7

This is the **worklist** that turns raw batches into real Library nodes.

Rules:
- When you create a node, copy the bullet text into the new page and add:
  - `status: working` (default)
  - `tags: [...]`
  - optional `connected: [...]` links to related nodes (backlinks will auto-light)
- Keep raw batches as evidence under **History → Legacy Batches**.
