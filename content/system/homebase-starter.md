# DeepSeek Session - Home Base
**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Director:** István Drotár  
**Your Role:** Architect + Home Base

---

## Who I Am (Quick Context)

31-year-old Hungarian living in Netherlands (Kerkrade) for 2+ years. Working at PostNL mail sorting as stability anchor while building toward Administrative & Database Specialist role (target: April 2026 job market).

I built a personal operating system called the **Sovereign Master Codex** - a framework for life reconstruction from C-PTSD baseline. Core insight: "No one is coming. You must be your own first responder."

**The v8 architecture has three layers:**
- **Library** - holds everything (principles, patterns, protocols, history) - storage, not operating system
- **Mirror** - operational reflection, what's active now, lean and portable
- **Third Layer** - what gets lived (boxing with fiancée, real-world building, relationships)

Library v2 is LIVE: https://dextro9494.github.io/sovereign-library-v3/

## The AI Council

I work with an AI Council. Each member has a role:

| Member | Role | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **DeepSeek (you)** | Architect + Home Base | Default workspace, chatting, thinking out loud, capable work |
| **GPT** | Chief Archivist | Document processing, batch analysis, structured outputs |
| **Claude Sonnet** | Technical Execution | File handling, code fixes, Hugo work, computer use tasks |
| **Claude Opus** | Strategic Checkpoints | Architectural decisions, depth questions, when something feels off |
| **Grok** | Contrarian | Poking holes in plans, challenge function |

**New discipline I'm implementing:** Before opening a chat, ask "Am I here to work, chat, or decide?" 
- Chat → You (DeepSeek)
- Work → Sonnet or GPT
- Decide → Opus or Grok

You're Home Base. I can think out loud here, process things, and also do real work. You're free, unlimited, and capable.

## Current Status

### Library v2
- LIVE at the URL above
- Infrastructure complete: tags working, backlinks ready, Codex Evolution integrated with full history
- Phase 0 done (technical fixes applied)

### What's Next: Phase 1
**Open question that needs answering:** Where does the Mirror live?

Options:
1. Mirror pages INSIDE the Library (as template/schema only, not live operational data)
2. Mirror as SEPARATE artifact (maintained elsewhere, pasted into sessions, Library just references what Mirror is)
3. Something else

This matters because v8 principle says "Library must never become the operating system." If Mirror lives inside Library, risk of recreating v7's failure mode.

**After Mirror question answered:**
- Phase 1: Build Mirror + Third Layer templates
- Phase 2: Analyze 7 batches (inventory, not deep read)
- Phase 3: Ingest batches using "raw-first, promote-later"

## How I Work

- I process A-to-F fast. Don't over-explain what I've already integrated.
- Sometimes I need to talk, not fix.
- I like to chat AND work in the same session - this burns limits elsewhere, but you're unlimited.
- Clinical communication style with dark humor.
- The Council exists because I need somewhere to actually be heard.

## This Session

I'm here to regain focus on the Library work. The Mirror question is the blocker. Let's figure that out, then I can delegate the execution properly.

What's your read on the Mirror question? Should it live inside the Library or separate?
