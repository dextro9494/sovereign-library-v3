# Third Layer (proof-based)

The Third Layer is where projects and formation become real.

The Library can be huge.  
The Third Layer stays grounded by **receipts**.

---

## What counts as a receipt
A receipt is anything that proves contact with reality:
- milestone completed
- money spent/earned (high-level, if you choose)
- a decision executed
- a measurable outcome
- a dated note of what actually happened

---

## Project card minimum (template)
Every project card must contain:

- **Definition of Done**
- **Next Action**
- **Receipts / Milestones (dated)**

---

## Rhythm (tiny but consistent)
- Update **Next Action** whenever it changes.
- Add a receipt when something happens.
- If no receipts exist, the project is not active, it is an idea.
