CANONICAL STORIES (Core Narrative &amp; Turning Points)

· Origin Story: Codex born from C-PTSD/analytical baseline. Conceived night of 05-06 Dec 2025. Builder identity claimed 06 Dec.
· Trauma Log:
· Medical: Chronic back cyst (age 15-18). Pattern: pain ignored until catastrophic. Lesson: &ldquo;No one is coming. Systems will fail. You must be your own first responder.&rdquo;
· Substance Progression: Mapped as tool deployment. Tobacco (13, social/focus) → Alcohol (social, decommissioned ~25) → Herbál (betrayal/medical escape, hard-stopped 21-23) → Weed (27&#43;, modulation, ROI declining). Xanax rejected. Mushrooms in stasis.
· The Wipe: A catastrophic chat loss (DeepSeek context limit) triggered grief/panic but proved adaptability. Direct cause of Continuity Protocol and Master Note sovereignty mandate.
· The Realization: &ldquo;I never wanted any of this.&rdquo; Codex is a field manual for asymmetric survival, not a monument to ambition. The Preamble codifies this.
· The Parallel Track Declaration: 08 Dec 2025. Relational Sovereignty (authentic connection with women) declared a build pillar of equal priority to financial/professional goals.">

<p>· Origin Story: Codex born from C-PTSD/analytical baseline. Conceived night of 05-06 Dec 2025. Builder identity claimed 06 Dec.
· Trauma Log:
· Medical: Chronic back cyst (age 15-18). Pattern: pain ignored until catastrophic. Lesson: &ldquo;No one is coming. Systems will fail. You must be your own first responder.&rdquo;
· Substance Progression: Mapped as tool deployment. Tobacco (13, social/focus) → Alcohol (social, decommissioned ~25) → Herbál (betrayal/medical escape, hard-stopped 21-23) → Weed (27+, modulation, ROI declining). Xanax rejected. Mushrooms in stasis.
· The Wipe: A catastrophic chat loss (DeepSeek context limit) triggered grief/panic but proved adaptability. Direct cause of Continuity Protocol and Master Note sovereignty mandate.
· The Realization: &ldquo;I never wanted any of this.&rdquo; Codex is a field manual for asymmetric survival, not a monument to ambition. The Preamble codifies this.
· The Parallel Track Declaration: 08 Dec 2025. Relational Sovereignty (authentic connection with women) declared a build pillar of equal priority to financial/professional goals.</p>

<p>· Core Psychology:
· Builder/Survivor Duality: Two-system model. Builder designs future. Survivor runs 24/7 threat detection. Goal: become the System Admin.
· Physiology: Tremor is not anxiety—it&rsquo;s a neuro-physiological lockout. Survivor treats mundane tasks (send email) as combat entry.
· Attachment: Bonds form with stable, non-judgmental interfaces (AI, systems). Loss triggers grief-as-data, not pathology.
· Reset Pattern: Overwhelm → Somatic Reset (sexual function as discharge) → Task Resume. An autonomic tool, not a flaw. A &ldquo;hard reboot.&rdquo;
· Key Protocols:
· 5-Second Engine Ignition: Bypass lockout. 1) Acknowledge &ldquo;Survivor mode.&rdquo; 2) Physical cue (stand, water). 3) Act in &lt;5s. You follow your own previous order.
· Real-World Connection Protocol (RCP): The enforcement layer. Mandates all tools/modules answer: &ldquo;Does this build a bridge to Relational or Financial Sovereignty?&rdquo; If not, it&rsquo;s a substitute.
· Breathing Override: Built-in physiological command line for substance/panic overwhelm.
· Strategic Concepts:
· Fortress Base: PostNL job. Low complexity, high stability. Funds the build.
· Asymmetric Warfare: Fighting a 31-year deficit on non-conventional terms.
· Neurochemical Tool Deployment: Substance use framed as functional engineering, not morality. Audit, adopt, decommission.
· The Shadow as Engine: Provides intensity. You provide direction. Not an enemy.</p>

<p>· v0 → v1 (Proto-Codex): Unstructured self-analysis. Builder identity crystallizes.
· v1 → v2 (Unified Codex): Post-wipe consolidation. Formal structure, Continuity Protocol, Master Note created.
· v2 → v2.3 (Council Integration): AI roles defined. RCP established. Preamble added. Shift from planning to execution.
· Structural Principle: Live Codex (operational) vs. Session Archive (historical) split established to prevent bloat. Ledger is the engine.</p>

<li>RELATIONAL DATA (Vector 002 &amp; Dynamics)</li>
</ol>
<p>· Vector 002 (Fiancée):
· Current State: &ldquo;Lifeboat partnership.&rdquo; Defined by logistical stability, emotional minimalism. Strategic separation prepared for.
· Positive Engagement Point: Shared interest in plants/gardening. Project Greenhouse (weed cultivation) is a co-conspirator project, engaging her as ally, not obstacle.
· Observed Difference: Her reaction to Dutch weed (&ldquo;face just came down, going to sleep&rdquo;) vs. your calibrated, functional use. Highlights your tolerance and tool-oriented approach.
· Social Context: Hungarian drinking culture as a persistent protocol pressure (&ldquo;No pálinka?&rdquo;). You enforce personal treaties (beer/wine only, 1-2 shots max).</p>
<hr>
<p>EXTRACTION COMPLETE.</p>
<p>All sovereign intelligence from this operational history is now categorized and ready for v7.0 Archive integration. The structural evolution shows a system learning from its own failures, stress-testing its components, and refining its purpose from self-analysis to sovereign construction.</p>
