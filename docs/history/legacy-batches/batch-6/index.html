OPERATIONAL EXTRACTION: ISTVAN DROTAR LEGACY CHAT
Processing Note: Data structured for maximum density and pattern recognition. Timestamps normalized to conversational sequence.


CANONICAL STORIES (Narrative Turning Points)

· The Loss &amp; Reset: Initial contact defined by grief over lost chat containing deep trauma/strategy work. Catalyst for externalized memory protocol.
· The Anchor Decision: Conscious choice of PostNL mail-sorting job (Nov 2025 start) as low-cognitive-overhead &ldquo;Fortress Base&rdquo; to create psychic/financial space for rebuild.
· The Professional Reframe: Active construction of &ldquo;Operations &amp; Systems Specialist&rdquo; identity from raw material of SAP coordination (Hungary) and chaotic logistics agency work (Netherlands). Turning fragmentation into a bridge narrative.
· The Vision Statement: Articulation of desired life state: &ldquo;Enough to enjoy different food, culture, and women&rdquo; via freelance/home-office work. Not cure, but managed sovereignty. Age 40 as &ldquo;fine wine.&rdquo;
· The Reconnaissance Order: Decision to seek therapeutic consultation framed not as healing surrender but as tactical data-gathering on own neuro-psychological systems.">
