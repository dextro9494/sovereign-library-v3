1) Locked Decisions
1.1 v3 is a new lineage and the active library

v3 will be the single unified library going forward.
No permanent v1/v2 folders in the final state.
All content &#43; context from v1/v2 must be ingested into v3 (not merely referenced by links back to v2).

Council → Insights: provenance/methodology/governance/attribution logs.\nConstitution: Director decides. Council provides intelligence. Never reverse this. 1.5 Home page message (locked) Home must retain the boundary message:\n“You are here uninvited, but since you are here…”\nTone target: “I’m giving you advice for free; take it or shove it.”\n1.6 Finance is first-class and public-safe (locked) Finance will be a top-level menu item. Finance will store numbers, categories, and general store names (e.g., Jumbo, Kaufland, Action). No receipts, no itemized purchases, no timestamps, no payment methods. 1.7 Finance supports Expected vs Actual vs Delta (locked) Each period can include Expected (pre), Actual (post), and Delta (observations only, not judgment). 1.8 Finance “month” is salary-cycle based (locked) A “financial month” is defined by salary arrival, not calendar months. Naming convention:\nFirst Cycle: 2025.12.23 (salary arrival date) Second Cycle: 2026.01.26/27 (expected next salary arrival date) Alternative short names allowed: Cycle 1 / Cycle 2. 2) v3 Build Artifacts Produced This Session Two files were generated earlier in this session:\nsovereign-library-v3-blueprint.md sovereign-library-v3-starter-pack.zip (Hugo-ready skeleton) If downloads fail, core contents were also pasted inline in chat.\n3) v3 Integration Strategy (updated requirement) 3.1 Non-negotiable v3 must contain everything from v1 and v2: no context loss. Do not keep v1/v2 as separate folders long-term. Do not rely on “go read v2 here” links. 3.2 Safe approach (agreed direction) Finish the v3 shell so it builds. Bulk-ingest all v2 content into v3 untouched (mechanical import). Run a link integrity pass (aliases/redirects or rewrite pass if needed). Only then “re-house” content into surfaces (Library/Mirror/Life/Council/Finance), without deleting anything. 4) Finance — Recorded Data 4.1 December 2025 income (recorded) PostNL: €2,572 Toeslagen: €371\nTotal income: €2,943 4.2 January 2026 income context (Expected; corrected) PostNL expected range: €2,600 – €3,000 (uncertain until payout) Toeslagen January total: €3,000 total Base: €750 Correction: €2,250 After January, toeslagen expected baseline: €750 / month 4.3 Expenses (recorded) Important: later the user clarified that the accounting period should be treated as a salary cycle starting 2025-12-23 and ending around the next salary 2026-01-26/27.\nHowever, expenses below are recorded with the dates provided.\nA) Shared ING — December 2025 (confirmed) (Originally “Dec 23 → today”, later confirmed as December.)\nOdido: €50.00 Water bill: €22.30 Gas-electricity: €192.00 Weed: €50.00 Disney+: €15.99 Vriendenloterij: €16.00 Bank fees: €3.90\nSubtotal Shared ING: €350.19 B) Personal ING — December 2025 Dec 24\nVriendenloterij: €16.00 Amazon: €4.99 Action: €105.37 Jumbo: €43.06 Vape store (Ella): €66.64 Kruidvat: €46.05 Dec 25 Jumbo: €47.38 Dec 26 Action: €29.95 Dec 27 Jumbo: €19.22 Dec 28 Gas station (Germany; fuel/tobacco): €43.71 Dec 29 Postcode Loterij: €21.00 Dec 30 Amazon Prime: €8.99 Jumbo: €56.22 Kaufland: €211.24 Tobacco: €25.00\nSubtotal Personal ING (Dec): €739.82 C) Personal ING — January 2026 (partial, dated) Jan 1: Lebara €31.50 Jan 5: VOG €33.85 Jan 6: ING credit card €45.83 Jan 12: ING costs €6.65\nSubtotal Personal ING (Jan so far): €117.83 D) Revolut — December 2025 Dec 23\nNexus Mods: €10.15 Syncasso (debt repayment): €120.00 Cash withdrawal: €120.00 (context: €80 friend debt, €40 weed) Dec 26 Cash withdrawal (weed): €40.00 OpenAI: €23.00 Google Play: €22.00 Dec 27 Revolut Plus plan: €3.99 Dec 28 Cash withdrawal (weed): €40.00 Dec 31 Cash withdrawal (weed): €40.00\nSubtotal Revolut (Dec): €419.14 E) Revolut — January 2026 (partial, dated) Jan 3: Cash withdrawal €40.00 Jan 5: Ella transfer €55.00 (Lebara + VOG) Jan 5: TotalEnergies €54.54 (gas + tobacco) Jan 5: Cash withdrawal €40.00 Jan 7: Cash withdrawal €40.00 Jan 9: KPN €26.00 Jan 11: Jumbo €13.67 Jan 14: Jumbo €0.37\nSubtotal Revolut (Jan so far): €269.58 4.4 Totals (computed from recorded subtotals) December expenses captured (all accounts):\nShared ING: €350.19 Personal ING (Dec): €739.82 Revolut (Dec): €419.14\nTotal December expenses captured: €1,509.15 Note: This is based on the dated entries supplied. The “salary-cycle” rule may later cause grouping by cycle rather than calendar month; no regrouping was performed in this session save.\n4.5 Debt context (recorded) Syncasso debt: €1,500 Already paid: €300 Monthly agreement: €150 5) What was explicitly deferred (no planning yet) No budgeting rules. No allocation decisions. No investment activation decision. DeGiro usage remains “prepared, not active” until the user says “we are ready”. 6) Next-session entry point 6.1 Confirm the ingestion constraint v3 becomes the unified library containing everything from v1/v2. Decide preferred migration mechanics (bulk copy + link integrity pass). 6.2 Finance: convert to Cycle format Create Cycle 1 (2025.12.23) page containing all entries in that salary cycle. Keep Expected vs Actual blocks for Cycle 2. 6.3 Continue Finance capture (optional) Add any missing expenses for Cycle 1. Add any additional income components if discovered. 7) One-line “state” for AI onboarding Building v3 as a unified library that ingests all v1/v2 content (no loss, no external references); finance tracking begins at baseline zero with salary-cycle periods and store-level totals.\n",
